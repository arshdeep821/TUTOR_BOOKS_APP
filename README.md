# My Personal Project Proposal

### Arshdeep Jaggo

### Project *Details* and *Description*:

The general idea of my project is to be a tutoring app 
that students can log onto and book appointments as **FREQUENTLY** 
as they want to for tutoring sessions. It will let students(the user)
book times for tutoring for a variety of subjects that they need aid with.
If the student can not make the appointment then they can **CANCEL** the appointment
and maybe try to **BOOK** for a different day and time of their choice. For example,
a student can book a session for tomorrow and next week, but they realize they can not make
it to the session for tomorrow. So they can cancel the session for tomorrow and maybe **REBOOK or CHANGE** it
later this week. They could select from a variety of courses that they would like to have help with.
For instance, some options could be **MATH, PHYSICS, ENGLISH, CHEMISTRY, etc**.
All these courses can be viewed in a list format so that it is easy for a student to select what 
course they want help with. 

This application will be best for students who are struggling to keep up with their academics
and course load. They will be able to use this app in order to get the extra help they need to pass
and excel in their courses. Anyone who needs that extra helping hand with an academic subject can log
onto this app and book tutoring sessions as often as they want, as long as it adheres to their schedule
to get the help they need. This would be especially useful during *midterms/finals* as a lot of material
needs to be covered and revising could be easier with the help of a tutor, which one can find via this app.

### *Why did I select this as my project?*

This idea interests me because I am currently a university student, and I understand that at times
the course load can be intense. I understand the perspective of a typical university student and how
they might need assistance with their work or help to catch up on a course. Sometimes the office hours
are just not enough, and you could really just use a one on one session with a tutor. This idea of making 
a tutoring application interests me because I could imagine myself utilizing an application like this in my
remaining years to get help with course work. I feel that it is something that would massively impact my studies
and improve my understanding of course material as well.

### User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to book a single or multiple tutoring sessions at different 
times throughout the week/month. In a sense, adding multiple tutoring sessions to my schedule
- As a user, I want to be able to cancel a booked appointment
- As a user, I want to be able to select the course I want tutoring for
- As a user, I want to be able to view a list of subjects available
- As a user, I want to be able to change a booked time
